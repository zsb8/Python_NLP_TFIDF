# Python_TFIDF
This programe was similar code which used in my NLP project.    
I developed a project aimed at helping patients better understand their symptoms using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. To achieve this, I leveraged the TD-IDF algorithm and NLP Facebook talking group data to develop a model that analyzes patient descriptions of their symptoms and provides helpful insights and potential diagnoses.     

This project required a deep understanding of NLP techniques, as well as the ability to effectively analyze and process large datasets of patient symptom descriptions. By leveraging the TD-IDF algorithm, I was able to accurately analyze patient descriptions and identify common symptoms and potential diagnoses.
